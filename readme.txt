== Description ==

Each day, CHQ outputs one of 365 quotes selected from the 7-volume Cosmic History Chronicles at [__Lawoftime.org__](http://Lawoftime.org/).

Cosmic History Quotes (CHQ) is a labor of love by Anthony Fogleman, 139 Blue Solar Storm, who shares peaceful practices with the world, and makes them able to be shared more. 

The Cosmic History Chronicles quote program was conceived by Juryt Abma of Netherlands - 243 Blue Solar Night, and me, his perfect guide.
